 <br/>
Here are my projects which I did during a 12 week bootcamp in the spring of 2018. This page is built in React, and the other projects are a mixture of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. <br/>
<br/>
This is also a chance for me to introduce myself as a person. I have worked with and studied a range of diffent things in my life, and the reason for this is that I am a curious and dedicated person by nature.<br/>
My passions in life are: reading, skiing, and taking care of my plants.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to hear from you!
