Here I will present my projects which I did during a 12 week bootcamp in the spring of 2018. This page is bulit in React and the other projects is a mixtur of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. <br/>
But this is also a chance for me to introduce myself as a person. I worked and study a range of diffent things in my life, and the reason for that is because I'm curious and dedicated by nature.<br/>
My passions in life are: reading, sking and taking care of my plants.<br/>
Hope to hear from you!
